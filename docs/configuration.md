# Configuration

The following document describes all the relevant configuration, preferences, and look-and-feel of the LiveCD.

## Terminal

[Sakura](https://github.com/dabisu/sakura) will used with `scrollbar=true` enabled in `sakura.conf`. This terminal emulator feels the cleanest with keeping all the most necessary features without intruding on my workflow. Specifically, having the special features hidden in just one right click away feels intuitive as someone might need them quickly from time to time but for the most part just wants to use the console.
