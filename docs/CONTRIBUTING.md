# Contribution

Contribute with trunk-based development by following these steps:

### Steps

For changes to documentation, commit and push as normal.

Otherwise, for any days worth of commits:

1) Pull to the latest master branch
2) Create a pull request and fill in the given template

If the PR passes the build check, then it can be merged to the main branch.

Ideally these pull requests should be small enough to contain only the code changes for that particular day. 

### Commits

Try following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) notation. For example, commit's with changes to documentation should start with "docs: ".
