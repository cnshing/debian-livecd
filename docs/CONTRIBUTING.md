# Contribution

Contribute with trunk-based development by following these steps:

## Steps

For changes to documentation, commit and push as normal.

Otherwise:

1) Pull to the latest master branch
2) Create a new temporary branch 
3) Apply your changes as normal
4) Create a pull request and fill in the given template
5) If the pull request does not fail the build check and is merged, then delete the temporary branch.

Ideally these pull requests should be small enough to contain only the code changes for that particular day. 

## Commits

Try following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) notation. For example, commit's with changes to documentation should start with "docs: ".
