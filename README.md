# debian-livecd
My personalized build of Debian

## Goals

This project aims to create LiveCD with the following:

* Pre-built preferred applications and customized look-and-feel
* Easily maintainable build configuration
* Reproducible and continuous build akin to rolling release

## Getting Started

Those that want to create their own version of the LiveCD can fork the repository and checkout the [`minimum-build`](https://github.com/cnshing/debian-livecd/releases/tag/minimum-build) tag, which contains everything you need to create a bare-bones system. The [overlays](https://github.com/clayrisser/linux-factory?tab=readme-ov-file#overlays) documentation is also available to further customize the image as needed.
